# Yours Sincerely
A theme with pretty pigments and a particular attention to detail.

I decided on this project after a struggle to find a warm, low-contrast theme to my liking. This is what I had in mind when searching. It comprises elements of Monokai, Tinacious, and the classic VS Dark.

## Themes

### Sunkissed

Low-contrast colours with minimal eye strain.

### Moonbeam

The polar twin of Sunkissed, focusing on the colder spectrum.
